# Rewinder

## Development

Disclamer:
> Don't take this codebase too seriously, it is mainly writen by AI, I just guided copilot/ChatGPT.
> I don't know very much about Rust, don't try to learn something from tristis repo.
> The codebase architecture is... non-existing. But I don't really care for now.
> Maybe I will just wait until AI is able to do this too.
